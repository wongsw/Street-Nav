The web application takes in GPS coordinates and outputs information about the street intersection, address and direction. The outputted information would be via speech.
Users can apply various settings: 
* How frequent current locations are updated (in seconds)
* How far should intersections be read out (in feet)
* How frequent new intersection information is retrieved (in seconds)
* Check for direction over past X seconds.
